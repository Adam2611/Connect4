Hello and welcome to the Connect 4 program, which was coded by Vanessa Ho, Andrew Yue, and Adam Lam. This program aims to simulate a real game of Connect Four.
This program has two modes: Player vs Player and Player vs AI. Before choosing which mode they would like to play, they are prompted to enter a name of their choice.
They are also given the option to choose the color of their checker, and in the PVP mode, the second players name and checker color will be asked for as well.
Afterwards, when the players are ready to begin, the game will ask who would like to start first. There is also a choice to "flip a coin" (the computer will choose who goes first randomly). After the final result of that game, the GUI will give the user an option to play again.

Features:
- Realistic board and checkers!
- Game personalization!
- Advanced GUI features: borders, colors, alignment, shapes!
- Efficient use of the game window!
- Utilises sound to indicate a win for the user and enhance their experience! 
- Two whole gamemodes for any age, regardless of skill! 
- Allows user to play again if he/she wishes!

How to Run:
1. Download the main Connect4.java file, then download the DrawCircle.java class with any web browser. Also make sure to download the Cheering.wav file so the sound in the GUI can run.
2. Open both programs in your preferred IDE. Make sure to have the Cheering.wav file somewhere in that folder as well.
3. Make sure that the DrawCircle is a subclass of the main class, Connect4.java.
4. Compile both prgrams, then run the Connect4.java file. Enjoy!

How to play: 
Players take turns placing down one checker at a time.
Checkers are affected by gravity and drop to the first available space, or if the column is empty, to the bottom of the board.
The first player to have four of their checkers in a row on the board -either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally- will be the winner. 
If the board is full and there is now winner, the game ends in a draw.

Player vs. Player:
Two players take turns placing down one checker at a time.
Player vs. AI:
One player will be able to test his skills in this mode. The player will be able to choose the difficulty of the AI: easy or hard.
